<p>A 25-year-old man has died a week after breaking his back, allegedly while being arrested by police officers</p> 

<p>Freddie Gray, from Sandtown-Winchester, Baltimore, is said to have suffered a broken vertebrae on Sunday April 12, as officers dragged him into a van.</p> 

<p>Footage recorded by a passerby has captured the incident.</p> 

<p>In the clip, police are seen dragging Gray over to a police van as a woman in the background screams at them to stop, claiming Gray had broken his leg.</p> 

<p>Gray was later taken to hospital, where he died on Sunday April 19 after spending a week in critical condition on the Shock Trauma ward.</p> 

<p>Police have not released any details of Gray's arrest or how he suffered the injury, but confirmed an internal investigation was under way, reports the Baltimore Sun.</p>

<p>Gray's family were too distraught to talk to the media.</p> 

<p>Since then, more than 100 protesters have gathered outside the Western District police station in Baltimore to demand answers.</p> 

<p>Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts said they were committed to providing the public with all the information about Gray's death.</p> 

<p>The mayor said: "I understand the frustration of the community and I take very seriously my obligation of transparency.</p> 

<p>"However we also have to balance that with our obligation to ensure a proper and thorough investigation is undertaken so that we can provide community with answers."</p>
