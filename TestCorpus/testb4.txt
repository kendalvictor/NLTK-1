<p>Innocence Project, told the Post: 'The FBI’s three-decade use of microscopic hair analysis to incriminate defendants was a complete disaster.</p>

<p>'We need an exhaustive investigation that looks at how the FBI, state governments that relied on examiners trained by the FBI and the courts allowed this to happen and why it wasn’t stopped much sooner.'</p>

<p>In a statement the FBI said they were committed to notifying defendants of past discrepancies and make sure 'justice is done in every instance'.</p>

<p>They added: '[We] are also committed to ensuring the accuracy of future hair analysis, as well as the application of all disciplines of forensic science.'</p>

<p>Of the 200 convictions affected by the errors, 32 defendants were sentenced to death - 14 of which have since been executed or died behind bars.</p>

<p>The FBI stopped its review of convictions in August 2013 after the initial troubling findings but resumed this month after at the Justice Department's orders.</font></p>

<p>The FBI stopped its review of convictions in August 2013 after the initial troubling findings but resumed this month after at the Justice Department's orders.</p>

<p>A report from the department's inspector general found that the FBI and Justice Department didn't move quickly enough to identify the cases handled by 13 FBI crime lab examiners whose work was found to be flawed, meaning defendants sometimes were never notified that their convictions may have been based on bad science.</p>

<p>It took almost five years for the FBI to identify the more than 60 death-row defendents whose cases required further examination, and during that time at least three were executed.</p>
