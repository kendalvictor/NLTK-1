<p>The Baltimore Police Department on Tuesday identified the six officers who have been suspended while the death of Freddie Gray is under investigation. The department did not say what role each of them played in Mr. Gray's arrest, but 
previously released information gives some idea for two of them.</p>

<p>Lt. Brian Rice was the senior officer involved, and officials have said it was a lieutenant on the scene, part of a team of officers patrolling on bicycles, who made eye contact with two men - one of them Mr. Gray, 25 - before they 
fled on foot, prompting the officers to pursue them. Lieutenant Rice, 41, is an 18-year veteran of the department.</p>

<p>Officer Garrett Miller filled out the "statement of charges" for arresting Mr. Gray, accusing him of carrying a switchblade knife, clipped to the inside of his pants pocket. Officer Miller, 26, a member of the department since 2012, 
wrote, "The defendant was arrested without force or incident."</p>

<p>The others suspended are Sgt. Alicia White, 30, who joined the department in 2010; Officer William Porter, 25, who joined in 2012; Officer Edward Nero, 29, who joined in 2012; and Police Officer Caesar Goodson, 45, who joined in 
1999.</p>
